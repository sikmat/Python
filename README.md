SETS: are usefull for removing duplicates from a list because they can only contain unique values and their order is randomized. Their elements cannot be accessed with index or slicing syntax. 
Explored sets union and how duplicates can be removed using examples from https://realpython.com/python-sets/

TUPLES: are also similar to List but declared with parenthesis() instead of square brackets[], but can also be without parenthesis. They cannot be modified, elements can be accessed via index. Take up less memory, usefull    for storing large amounts of data compared to lists. Also useful for returning multiple values from a a function.

DICTIONARIES: work with Key-Value pairs. import defaultdict from collections package, it easier to work with. defaultdict creates a new default value if a key doesn't exist yet, instead returning an error. You must specify   the type of object you want returned.

LIST COMPREHENSIONS: enclosed in square brackets. Enables you to filter or apply functions to every item in the list. They are useful for cleaning string and handling large datasets

LIST COMPREHENSIONS with FUNCTIONS
SPLIT Function: Allows you to split a string based on a given character or string, using a period as a delimiter or spaces if there is no delimiter available. The string is then separated from the period. 
To remove periods and apply lowercase we can create a function which uses "replace" and "lower" functions to remove periods and convert string to lowercase
