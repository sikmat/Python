SETS: are usefull for removing duplicates from a list because they can only contain unique values and their order is randomized. Their elements cannot be accessed with index or slicing syntax. 
Explored sets union and how duplicates can be removed using examples from https://realpython.com/python-sets/

TUPLES: are also similar to List but declared with parenthesis() instead of square brackets[], but can also be without parenthesis. They cannot be modified, elements can be accessed via index. Take up less memory, usefull    for storing large amounts of data compared to lists. Also useful for returning multiple values from a a function.

DICTIONARIES: work with Key-Value pairs. import defaultdict from collections package, it easier to work with. defaultdict creates a new default value if a key doesn't exist yet, instead returning an error. You must specify   the type of object you want returned.
